## Programmers
We need to do what any animal in nature does when it’s cornered, act erratically, and blindly lash out at everything around us.

It’s weird. They always travel in groups of five. These programmers, there’s always a tall, skinny white guy; short, skinny Asian guy; fat guy with a ponytail; some guy with crazy facial hair; and then an East Indian guy. It’s like they trade guys until they all have the right group.
